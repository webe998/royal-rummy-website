                <p>
                    In the event of any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services, you and Royal
                    Rummy agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute informally. If the dispute cannot be resolved
                    informally, both parties agree to binding arbitration as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator in accordance with the American
                        Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules.</li>
                    <li>The arbitration will be conducted in New York, New York, unless both parties agree to conduct it
                        elsewhere.</li>
                    <li>The arbitrator will have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the
                        interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    You agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and
                    not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court
                    rather than in arbitration, you and Royal Rummy each waive any right to a jury trial.

                <p>
                    These Terms and your use of the Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
                    laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
                    rule.

                <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
                <p>
                    These Terms, our Privacy Policy, Refund Policy, and any other agreements expressly incorporated by
                    reference herein constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and Royal Rummy regarding the
                    Services and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations,
                    and warranties.
                </p>

                <h3>Waiver</h3>
                <p>
                    No waiver by Royal Rummy of any term or condition set out in these Terms shall be deemed a further
                    or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any
                    failure by Royal Rummy to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a
                    waiver of such right or provision.
                </p>

                <h3>Severability</h3>
                <p>
                    If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be
                    invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to
                    the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue in full force and
                    effect.
                </p>

                <h3>Assignment</h3>
                <p>
                    You may not assign these Terms without the prior written consent of Royal Rummy. Royal Rummy may
                    freely assign these Terms without restriction.
